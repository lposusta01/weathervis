# weathervis
weather visualizer using the NWS weather API for my AP comp sci class

this does not compile on my personal (linux) machine, and thus i'm going to assume it won't work on most machines. probably because of all of the tomfoolery i did involving Jakarta EE/jsonp. im assuming there's some quirk of the macos dev environment i was using, or macos in general, that means the dev environment i started this project on is (for the time being) the only place where it can be compiled.
